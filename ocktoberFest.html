      </h2>
    <p>
      Oktoberfest is the world’s largest beer festival, held annually in Munich, Germany. This iconic event takes place over 16 to 18 days, typically from late September to the first weekend of October, attracting millions of visitors from around the globe. The festival began in 1810 to celebrate the wedding of Crown Prince Ludwig and Princess Therese, and it has since evolved into a major celebration of Bavarian culture.

      At Oktoberfest, enormous beer tents, run by Munich's traditional breweries, serve specially brewed Oktoberfest beer in large steins, alongside a variety of hearty Bavarian foods like pretzels, sausages, roast chicken, and pork knuckles. The event is accompanied by live music, parades, and folk performances, creating a festive atmosphere.
      
      Visitors dress in traditional Bavarian attire—men in lederhosen and women in dirndls—adding to the cultural experience. While beer is the main attraction, Oktoberfest also features carnival rides, games, and a variety of family-friendly activities.
      
      Oktoberfest is renowned not only for its beer and food but also for celebrating Bavarian heritage, making it a global cultural phenomenon that draws millions of beer lovers and tourists each year.
