        Sapporo Snow Festival & Ramen Show (Sapporo, Japan)
      </h2>
    <p>
      The Sapporo Snow Festival, held annually in Sapporo, Japan, is a spectacular winter event that showcases stunning snow and ice sculptures. Taking place over seven days in early February, the festival attracts millions of visitors from around the world. It began in 1950 when local students created a few snow sculptures in Odori Park, and it has since grown into one of Japan's largest winter festivals.

The highlight of the festival is the intricate ice and snow sculptures, some towering several meters high, depicting everything from famous landmarks to beloved characters. The festival features three main sites: Odori Park, Susukino, and Tsudome, each offering unique attractions, including live performances, snow slides, and food stalls.

In conjunction with the Snow Festival, the Sapporo Ramen Show is also held, celebrating Japan's famous noodle dish. Visitors can sample various regional ramen styles from different vendors, showcasing Sapporo's renowned miso ramen, as well as flavors from across the country.

Together, the Sapporo Snow Festival and Ramen Show create a vibrant atmosphere filled with art, culture, and culinary delights, making it a must-visit winter experience for both locals and tourists alike.
